"""FastAPI entrypoint for muse-ai-lite.

Assembles the application and nothing else: middleware, Prometheus
instrumentation, the Postgres-table bootstrap, the liveness probe, the router
includes, and (in production) the built-frontend mount. All real behavior lives
in the routers and the packages they delegate to:

  - app.api.auth   -> /auth/*  (register/login/refresh/logout/google/me)
  - app.api.chat   -> /ws + /transcribe (the chat transport)
  - app.api.admin  -> /admin/* (model registry, rollback, data wipe)

Run with:  uvicorn app.main:app  (from the backend/ directory).
