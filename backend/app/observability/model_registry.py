"""Lightweight model registry for API-hosted models.

Single source of truth for which model each agent runs on,
with version history and live rollback.

Why this exists: model choice is an operational lever, not a code constant.
agents.py asks `get_model(agent)` at call time, so flipping a model takes effect
on the next turn with no redeploy. The /admin endpoints in main.py read this
registry and trigger `rollback`, giving a fast "undo" if a newly promoted model
regresses in production. State is in-memory, so changes reset on restart — fine
for a demo, but a real deployment would back this with a datastore.

NOTE: llm_metrics.py prices each call via get_model() — add a PRICES row in
llm_metrics when you point an agent at a new model id here.
