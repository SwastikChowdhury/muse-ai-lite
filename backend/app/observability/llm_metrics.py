"""
LLM token-usage and cost accounting.

Separate from metrics.py because this concerns spend rather than service health:
it turns each Gemini response's usage_metadata into Prometheus counters for
tokens consumed and estimated USD cost, broken out per agent. Lets us watch the
relative cost of the conversation vs. whisper agents and catch runaway spend.

Cost is an *estimate*: token counts are exact (from the API), but USD is computed
from Google's published per-1M-token rates below. The model id comes from
model_registry.get_model() at record time (including after live rollbacks).
Add a PRICES entry whenever REGISTRY adopts a new model id. record_usage is
called by agents.py (whisper) and orchestrator.py (conversation, after the stream).
