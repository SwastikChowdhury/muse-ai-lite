"""
MongoDB persistence layer for chat transcripts and coaching whispers.

Thin async data-access module: it owns the Mongo connection and the small set
of read/write helpers main.py uses to persist and replay a conversation. There
is intentionally no ORM and no business logic here — callers pass in validated
`models.Message` objects and get back plain dicts.

Two collections under the "muse" database:
  - messages  -> the mentor/mentee dialogue (role "user"/"assistant")
  - whispers  -> the private coaching notes (role "whisper")
They are kept separate so the conversation transcript and the coach's
side-channel can be queried and cleared independently.

Uses Motor (async MongoDB driver) so these calls don't block the event loop
that's also servicing the chat websocket.
