"""
Per-turn multi-agent orchestration — the "brain" that sequences the two agents.

Sits between the transport layer (main.py) and the raw agent calls (agents.py).
Given one mentor message, `handle_turn` coordinates the whole turn:

  1. Retrieve relevant past-session memories for this user (vector search).
  2. Stream the mentee reply to the client (conversation agent), with retries.
  3. Signal the reply is done, then run the whisper/coach agent, with retries.
  4. Verify the whisper's memory citations are real (anti-hallucination), strip
     the [Mn] markers, and send the cleaned note to the client.
  5. Persist this mentor message to memory for future turns.

Why the agents run in this order (sequential, not parallel): the whisper agent
critiques the *latest exchange*, so it needs the mentee's reply as input.
Streaming the mentee reply first also gets visible output to the user fastest,
while the (slower, blocking) coaching note is computed afterward.

Resilience model: Gemini Flash models are rate-limited and occasionally
overloaded, so both agent calls are wrapped in bounded retry loops that
degrade gracefully (a friendly message) instead of crashing the socket. Every
attempt and outcome is recorded to Prometheus.

Side effects: streams JSON frames over the websocket, writes to vector memory,
and increments several metrics. It does NOT touch MongoDB — main.py persists
the returned values.
