"""
Pydantic data models — the canonical shape of records stored in MongoDB.

These define the wire/storage contract used throughout the backend: db.py calls
`.model_dump()` on them to produce BSON documents, and main.py constructs them
per turn. Timestamps default to timezone-aware UTC so ordering is unambiguous
regardless of server locale.

The current single-user demo only actively persists `Message`; `User` and
`Conversation` describe the intended multi-tenant schema and are the seam where
real per-user/per-conversation modelling would plug in.
